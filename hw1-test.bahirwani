I tested my program to check for the entire range of inputs from zero conditions met to all conditions met. Also, I tested giving inputs present in the common.txt file to ensure that a password present there is found, even for the edge cases. I first implemented the program without recursion and later using recursion. I have commented out the non-recursive implementation in the file I have submitted.Thanks!
